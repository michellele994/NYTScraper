# NYT Search Scrubber
This project was a homework due for the Trilogy & University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp. This project was intended to hone my skills in
 * React
 * CSS
 * Javascript
 * jQuery
 * JSX
 * Axios
 * Node
 * ExpressJS
 * MongoDB
 * Mongoose
 * Heroku

## Overview
The homework for this project instructed me to construct an article scrubber using React and articles from New York Times.
 * Search articles from the New York Times querying your topic of choice. After this is done, define the start and end date of the articles you interested in.
 * Click submit, and then a list of 5 articles will be displayed to the user under "Results". There is an option to save the article, which will transfer the information to a mongodb.
 * Once an article is saved, it will be displayed under "Saved Article", which also provides the option of removing it from the user's list of articles, also deleting it from the mongodb.
